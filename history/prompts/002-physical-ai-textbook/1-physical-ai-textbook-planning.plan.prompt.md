# Prompt History Record: Physical AI Textbook Planning

## PROMPT_TEXT
proceed

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Completed the implementation planning for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. Created all required planning artifacts including:

1. Updated implementation plan (plan.md) with technical context, constitution check, and project structure
2. Created research.md with comprehensive research on Docusaurus framework and implementation approach
3. Created data-model.md defining the content structure and entities
4. Created quickstart.md with setup and contribution guidelines
5. Created API contract (contracts/textbook-api.yaml) for potential interactive services
6. Updated agent context with new technology stack information

All constitutional requirements were verified and passed. The plan follows a Docusaurus-based approach for delivering the 13-week curriculum as a static site deployed on GitHub Pages.

## OUTCOME
Planning phase completed successfully with all required artifacts created. Ready to proceed with implementation tasks.

## EVALUATION
The planning phase successfully addressed all requirements from the feature specification, including the 13-week curriculum structure, GitHub Pages deployment, and support for assessment projects. The Docusaurus framework selection aligns with the educational goals and technical requirements.
