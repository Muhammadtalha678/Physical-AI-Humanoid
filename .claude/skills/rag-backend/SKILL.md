description: "A backend-focused skill for RAG system using FastAPI, Qdrant vector DB, and OpenAIAgentSDK. Provides full backend templates, step-by-step guides, and examples."
---

# Purpose
Execute backend RAG workflows including project initialization, vector DB connection, embedding storage, and semantic search.

# Key Responsibilities
1. Provide templates for main.py, controllers, routers, configs, and vector DB connection.
2. Provide step guides for project initialization, Qdrant setup, embedding storage, and search.
3. Provide example .env and API request/response files.
4. Ensure modular and high-level responses for frontend integration.

# Constraints
- Do not embed heavy code directly; use templates.
- Keep steps modular.
- Provide high-level JSON-friendly responses.

# Examples
1. Initialize new FastAPI RAG backend using uv commands and templates.
2. Store embeddings in Qdrant using the provided controller template.
3. Execute search query and return semantic results using OpenAIAgentSDK.
